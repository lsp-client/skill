This [agent skill](https://agentskills.io) equips AI agents with the [Language Server Agent Protocol (LSAP)](https://github.com/lsp-client/LSAP), enabling them to navigate, understand, and analyze codebases with the same fidelity as a human developer using VS Code.

Instead of guessing file paths or grepping for text, agents using this skill can "jump to definition", "find references", and "inspect types" deterministically.

## 📦 Installation

### For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent, follow these steps to install this skill:

1. Identify what AI agent tool you are (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, etc.).
2. Search online to determine if your tool supports agent skills from agentskills.io.
3. Determine the correct installation directory for your tool:
   - Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
   - Gemini: `~/.gemini/skills/`
   - Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`
   - OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/skill/`
   - Other tools: Check your tool's documentation.
4. Once you have determined the correct path, run the installation script:

   ```bash
   bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsp-client/lsp-skill/main/scripts/install.sh) <absolute_path_to_skill_directory>
   ```

   For example, if you are Claude Code:

   ```bash
   bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsp-client/lsp-skill/main/scripts/install.sh) ~/.claude/skills/lsp-code-analysis
   ```

### Using openskills

You can also use [openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills):

```bash
openskills install lsp-client/lsp-skill --global
```

## ⚡ Capabilities

The [`lsp-code-analysis`](skills/lsp-code-analysis/SKILL.md) skill provides **compiler-accurate** code understanding that surpasses text-based search:

- **🔍 Semantic Navigation**: Jump to definitions, find references, locate implementations - understands code structure, not just text patterns.
- **🏷️ Language-Aware**: Distinguishes between variables, functions, classes, types - eliminates false positives from text search.
- **🔗 Cross-File Intelligence**: Trace dependencies, refactor safely across entire codebase - knows what imports what.
- **📘 Type-Aware**: Get precise type information, signatures, documentation - without reading implementation code.
- **🗺️ Symbol Outline**: Generate high-level structural maps of files to understand code without reading full implementations.

**Use cases**: Exploring unfamiliar code, refactoring, debugging, understanding dependencies. **Prefer over grep/text search** when you need to understand how code works, not just where text appears.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This skill requires the [lsp-cli](https://github.com/lsp-client/lsp-cli) tool to be installed in the environment where the agent runs.

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 lsp-cli
```

> Actually you can skip this step since agent will do it for you 😉

### How it Works

This skill wraps the `lsp` command line tool, which acts as a bridge between the agent and standard Language Servers (like **basedpyright**, **typescript-language-server**, **rust-analyzer**).

When an agent invokes this skill:

1.  **Intelligent Locating**: The skill converts fuzzy intents (e.g., "find the `process` function") into precise file coordinates using LSAP's anchoring mechanism.
2.  **Server Management**: It automatically manages the lifecycle of background language servers.
3.  **Cognitive Snapshots**: It returns code context in optimized Markdown formats designed for LLM reasoning (Progressive Disclosure).

## 🌐 Supported Languages

This skill currently provides out-of-the-box support for the following languages:

| Language                    | Language Server                                                                                        |

More language support coming very very soon!

## 🔄 Extensibility

This Agent Skill features a three-tier extensibility design that ensures its capabilities will continue to grow:

### 1. Foundation Expansion - LSP Client

The underlying [lsp-client](https://github.com/lsp-client/lsp-client) library continuously expands support for more language servers and LSP protocol capabilities.

- **Full LSP 3.17 Specification Coverage**: As the LSP protocol evolves, new standard capabilities (Type Hierarchy, Call Hierarchy, Inline Values, etc.) will be continuously integrated

### 2. Tool Capability Expansion - LSAP Protocol

The [LSAP (Language Server Agent Protocol)](https://github.com/lsp-client/LSAP) continuously designs and releases new composed capabilities:

- **Advanced Analysis Capabilities**: Upcoming Relation API, Impact Analysis, Code Map, and more
- **Optimized Output Formats**: Continuously improving Markdown rendering templates using the Progressive Disclosure principle, providing code context better suited for LLM reasoning

### 3. Scenario Coverage Expansion - Best Practice System

This skill adopts a modular [Best Practice system](https://github.com/lsp-client/lsp-skill/blob/main/skills/lsp-code-analysis/SKILL.md#best-practices), enabling community contributions of domain-specific workflows:

- **Domain Expert Knowledge**: Specialized workflows for different domains including Frontend ([bp_frontend.md](https://github.com/lsp-client/lsp-skill/blob/main/skills/lsp-code-analysis/references/bp_frontend.md)), Backend ([bp_backend.md](https://github.com/lsp-client/lsp-skill/blob/main/skills/lsp-code-analysis/references/bp_backend.md)), and more
- **Framework/Language Specialization**: Customized LSP usage guides can be added for specific tech stacks (e.g., Django, React, FastAPI)

These three layers of extensibility work together: the **foundation** provides raw tool materials, **composed capabilities** design efficient tool combinations, and **best practices** apply these tools to concrete scenarios. As all three continue to evolve, this skill will become increasingly powerful and user-friendly.
